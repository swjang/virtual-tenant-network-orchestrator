In era of cloud computing, tenants have more and more data interactions with datacenter network, and also secure connections, QoS and elastic adjustment are needed.

Esp. in designing high availability architectures using multi-regions we need to address the following set of challenges:

	Workload Migration - ability to migrate our application environment across regions
	Data Synch - ability to migrate real time copy of the data between the two or more regions
	Network Flow - ability to enable flow of network traffic between two or more regions
